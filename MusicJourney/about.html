            <h2><strong>My Musical Journey</strong></h2>
            <p>I grew up with a passive relationship to musicâ€”I didn&rsquo;t dislike it, but I wasn&rsquo;t particularly engaged with it either. I mostly focused on lyrics and vocals, not the music itself.</p>
            <p>Everything changed when some online friends introduced me to music production using FL Studio, a digital audio workstation. Initially, my projects were far from impressive; I lacked the knowledge and ear for music. Despite this, I continued creating, learning, and experimenting. Through countless tutorials, mistakes, and hours of practice, I gradually improved.</p>
            <h3><strong>Progress</strong></h3>
            <p>Seeing the progress I made over time was incredibly rewarding. My early projects were noticeably different from those I produced after a year of dedicated learning. The growth in my skills and the quality of my work gave me a profound sense of accomplishment.</p>
            <p>Today, I&rsquo;m a vastly improved producer compared to four years ago. My taste in music has evolved, and I&rsquo;ve made significant strides in music theory, mixing, and melody creation. My style has notably changed since discovering electronic dance music and ambient soundtracks. I now focus on creating ethereal tracks, including ambient, house, and techno, as well as cinematic soundtracks that I hope to see in films.</p>
            <h4><strong>Today</strong></h4>
            <p>While I focus on these genres, I still explore pop and hip hop if inspiration strikes. I remain open to diverse musical ideas and continue to experiment with different styles. Although I&rsquo;ve made considerable progress, I&rsquo;m still developing my piano skills, which are currently at a beginner to intermediate level.</p>
