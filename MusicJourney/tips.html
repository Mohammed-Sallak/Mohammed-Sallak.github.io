            <h2>Production Tips</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Listen To Other Tracks:</strong> It is always important to look at other's music within the genre you are making. Seeing certain patterns, commonly used sounds, techniques, and just getting fresh ideas for your music.</li>
                <li><strong>Understand EQ:</strong> Learning equalization and how to carve out space for everything in your mix might single-handedly the most important thing in music. You could have the best melody and drums in the world, but without proper equalization and mixing, it will sound terrible.</li>
                <li><strong>Don't Overthink It:</strong> Do not overcomplicate things for yourself, if you think something sounds good, then use it, if you think it sounds bad, then don't. If you have a simple section that works very well, but you feel like it doesn't have enough, don't add. Less is more in music. Of course this does not mean that you shouldn't make complicated music, just balance the use of simplicity and complexity well.
                <li><strong>Don't Box Yourself:</strong> Be creative about your music, don't be afraid to try very different elements together, it might not work, or you might get an extremely beautiful sound melody, or a very unique drum pattern. Basically, do whatever's on your mind.</li>
