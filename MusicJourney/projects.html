            <h2>"Warmth - An Ambient Journey"</h2>
            <img src="images/warmth.jpg" alt="Image for the track 'Warmth'">
            <p>This is one of my favorite ambient tracks I have produced. I created a very evocative chord progression to set a calming and introspective mood. The track features lush, evolving textures and gentle, layered synths that create a sense of warmth and tranquility. I focused on subtle dynamics and smooth transitions to ensure a soothing listening experience. This piece was inspired by one of my favorite songs in the genre called "Retire" by Alvedon.</p>

            <h2>"New World" - My Best Drum & Bass Track</h2>
            <img src="images/walkingonadream.png" alt="Image for the track 'New World'">
            <p>Although the melodies in <strong>"New World"</strong> were still very important, I also focused on finding the right rhythm and samples. The breakbeat that I sampled was from Splice, an extremely popular sample library. I also added different percussions and sound effects to keep the listener engaged throughout the song. Mixing the track posed some challenges, but eventually, I got it just right.</p>

            <h2>"Pedal" - A Journey Through Emotions</h2>
            <img src="images/pedal.jpg" alt="Image for the track 'Pedal'">
            <p><strong>"Pedal"</strong> is a deep, intense, and ethereal track that takes the listener on an emotional journey. The slow tempo and rich, textured layers create a profound sense of depth and immersion. I focused on building a strong atmosphere, using smooth transitions and a blend of organic and synthetic sounds to evoke a wide range of emotions. This track was inspired by a night I spent on a desert vacation with my family.</p>

            <h2>"Air" - Ethereal Soundscapes with Jerk Drum Patterns</h2>
            <img src="images/enough.png" alt="Image for the track 'Air'">
            <p>"<strong>Air"</strong> is one of my more unique projects. I continued with the evocative and ethereal melodies, but decided to implement something new with the drums: Jerk drums. Jerk drums are very unique to Caribbean music, mainly Jamaican Dancehall. After trying it out, I found that the fast-paced rhythm complemented the slower and heavier melodies exceptionally well, creating a unique and captivating sound.</p>

            <h2>"Spaceship" - A Fusion of Hard-Hitting Drums with Smooth Melodies</h2>
            <img src="images/spaceship.jpg" alt="Image for the track 'Spaceship'" class="smaller-image">
            <p><strong>"Spaceship"</strong> is a complete 180 compared to my other soundtracks. It is much more hip hop-esque, using rougher and harder-sounding drums. The name perfectly reflects what you will hearâ€”it feels like you are in a spaceship. It still retains some of my usual techniques and ideas, such as beautifully layered melodies and ethereal sounds with a lot of effects. My inspiration for this song was Bryson Tiller, a music artist whose music shares many of these features.</p>
